## Changes Made

### 1. EditMaintenanceRequestModal.jsx

#### Removed Fields:
- **Status field** - Removed from form state and UI
- **Category field** - Removed from form state and UI

#### Changes:
1. **Form State** - Updated `formData` to remove `status` and `category`:
   ```jsx
   // Before:
   const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
     title: '',
     description: '',
     priority: 'Medium',
     status: 'Open',
     equipment: [],
     date: '',
     category: 'maintenance'
   });

   // After:
   const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
     title: '',
     description: '',
     priority: 'Medium',
     equipment: [],
     date: ''
   });
   ```

2. **Form Initialization** - Removed status and category from data population

3. **Validation** - Removed validation for status and category fields:
   - Removed from `validateField` switch cases
   - Removed from `fieldsToValidate` array

4. **Form Submission** - Removed status and category from update payload

5. **UI Layout** - Changed from two rows to one row:
   - **Before**: Priority/Status in one row, Due Date/Category in another row
   - **After**: Priority/Due Date in one row

6. **Removed Elements**:
   - Status select dropdown
   - Category select dropdown
   - Debug info showing category
   - `normalizeCategory` function

### 2. WorkRequestDetailsModal.jsx

#### Added:
- **`useHideNavbar` hook** - Now hides navigation bar when modal is open

#### Removed:
- **Category section** from the sidebar

#### Changes:
1. **Import Statement** - Added useHideNavbar:
   ```jsx
   import { useHideNavbar } from '../../../shared/hooks/useHideNavbar';
   ```

2. **Hook Usage** - Added at the top of the component:
   ```jsx
   export const WorkRequestDetailsModal = ({ ... }) => {
     useHideNavbar(isOpen);
     // ... rest of component
   }
   ```

3. **Edit Data Initialization** - Removed category from `editData`:
   - Removed complex category normalization logic
   - Removed category from the state object

4. **Save Handler** - Removed category from the backend payload:
   - No longer sends category field to backend when saving

5. **UI Changes**:
   - Removed entire "Category" card from sidebar
   - Removed category select dropdown from edit mode
