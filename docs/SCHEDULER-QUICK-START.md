# Automatic Maintenance Scheduler - Quick Summary

## What Was Implemented

‚úÖ **Automated maintenance scheduling system** that:
1. Auto-schedules preventive maintenance when equipment is created
2. Equipment stays "Operational" after creation
3. Automatically changes status to "Under Maintenance" when scheduled date arrives
4. Sends notifications to admins and technicians

---

## How It Works

### Timeline Example:

**Day 0:** Equipment Created
- Status: `Operational` ‚úÖ
- Maintenance scheduled for Day 90

**Day 1-89:** Normal Operation
- Status: `Operational` ‚úÖ
- Cron job checks every hour (finds nothing due)

**Day 90 at 00:00:** Maintenance Date Arrives
- Cron job finds due maintenance
- Equipment status: `Operational` ‚Üí `Under Maintenance` ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Notifications sent to:
  - All Admins
  - Assigned Technician

---

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `backend/services/maintenanceSchedulerService.js` - Cron job service

### Modified:
- `backend/services/notificationService.js` - Added maintenance start notifications
- `backend/modules/workforce-facility/controllers/EquipmentController.js` - Restored auto-scheduling
- `backend/server.js` - Initialize scheduler on startup

---

## Key Features

### Cron Job Configuration
- **Frequency:** Every hour at minute 0
- **Timezone:** Asia/Colombo (configurable)
- **Start:** Automatically on server startup

### Notification Details
- **Type:** SCHEDULED_MAINTENANCE_STATUS_UPDATED
- **Title:** "Maintenance Started"
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Recipients:** All Admins + Assigned Technician
- **Message:** "Scheduled maintenance has started for [Equipment]. Status changed to 'Under Maintenance'."

---

## Testing

### Quick Test:
```bash
# 1. Create equipment (auto-schedules maintenance)
POST /api/equipment
{
  "name": "Test Equipment",
  "type": "Diagnostic",
  "location": "Lab",
  "status": "Operational",
  "maintenanceInterval": 90
}

# 2. Check server logs
‚úÖ Auto-scheduled preventive maintenance for EQ-1234

# 3. Create maintenance with past date (for immediate testing)
POST /api/scheduled-maintenance
{
  "equipment_id": ["..."],
  "scheduled_date": "2025-10-12",  // Yesterday
  "status": "Scheduled"
}

# 4. Wait for next hour or restart server
# Check logs for:
‚è∞ Running scheduled maintenance check...
‚úÖ Updated EQ-1234 status to "Under Maintenance"
üìß Sent maintenance start notification
```

## Benefits

1. ‚úÖ **Zero Manual Work** - Everything happens automatically
2. ‚úÖ **No Forgotten Maintenance** - System never forgets
3. ‚úÖ **Real-Time Notifications** - Everyone knows immediately
4. ‚úÖ **Accurate Status** - Equipment marked unavailable automatically
5. ‚úÖ **Predictive Maintenance** - Scheduled proactively based on intervals

---

## Configuration

### Change Cron Frequency:
```javascript
// In maintenanceSchedulerService.js

// Current: Every hour
'0 * * * *'

// Change to every 30 minutes:
'*/30 * * * *'

// Change to once a day at 8 AM:
'0 8 * * *'
```

### Change Timezone:
```javascript
// In maintenanceSchedulerService.js
timezone: "America/New_York"  // or your timezone
```

---

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Equipment Status Flow:**
1. Created: `Operational`
2. Scheduled date arrives: `Under Maintenance` (automatic)
3. Technician completes: `Operational` (manual)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Maintenance Interval:**
- Still optional field
- If provided: Used to calculate scheduled date
- If empty: No automatic scheduling

‚ö†Ô∏è **Server Restart:**
- Cron job initializes on startup
- Runs initial check immediately
- Then continues hourly schedule

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cron not running?
```bash
# Check server logs for:
‚úÖ Maintenance Scheduler initialized - Running every hour

# If missing, verify in server.js:
maintenanceSchedulerService.initializeMaintenanceScheduler();
```

### Status not updating?
```bash
# Verify:
1. Scheduled maintenance exists with scheduled_date ‚â§ today
2. Maintenance status is "Scheduled" or "Assigned"
3. Equipment status is "Operational"
4. Check logs for error messages
```

### No notifications?
```bash
# Verify:
1. Admin users exist in database
2. Check notifications collection for new entries
3. Look for error in logs
```

## Summary

You now have a **fully automated maintenance system** where:
1. Equipment gets auto-scheduled maintenance
2. Equipment stays operational until maintenance date
3. Status automatically changes to "Under Maintenance" when due
4. Notifications alert everyone involved

**No manual intervention needed! üéâ**
