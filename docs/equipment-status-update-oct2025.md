# Equipment Status Update - Removed "Scheduled for Maintenance"

## Date: October 13, 2025

---

## Summary of Changes

**Objective:** Remove the "Scheduled for Maintenance" status from the equipment section in the maintenance module of the admin dashboard.

**Rationale:** Simplify equipment status management by consolidating maintenance-related statuses. Equipment will now use "Under Maintenance" when maintenance work is being performed, rather than having separate "Scheduled for Maintenance" and "Under Maintenance" statuses.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend - Database Model

**File:** `backend/modules/workforce-facility/models/Equipments.js`

#### A. Updated Status Enum
**Before:**
```javascript
enum: {
  values: ['Operational', 'Under Maintenance', 'Out of Service', 'Needs Repair', 'Scheduled for Maintenance'],
  message: 'Equipment status must be one of the predefined options'
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
enum: {
  values: ['Operational', 'Under Maintenance', 'Out of Service', 'Needs Repair'],
  message: 'Equipment status must be one of the predefined options'
}
```

#### B. Updated scheduleNextMaintenance Method
**Before:**
```javascript
equipmentSchema.methods.scheduleNextMaintenance = function (date) {
  this.nextMaintenance = date;
  if (this.status === 'Operational') this.status = 'Scheduled for Maintenance';
  return this.save();
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
equipmentSchema.methods.scheduleNextMaintenance = function (date) {
  this.nextMaintenance = date;
  // Status remains unchanged when scheduling maintenance
  return this.save();
};
```

---

### 2. Backend - Validation Middleware

**File:** `backend/middleware/validation.js`

Updated three validation schemas:

#### A. Create Equipment Schema
```javascript
status: Joi.string()
  .valid('Operational', 'Under Maintenance', 'Out of Service', 'Needs Repair')
  .default('Operational'),
```

#### B. Update Equipment Schema
```javascript
status: Joi.string()
  .valid('Operational', 'Under Maintenance', 'Out of Service', 'Needs Repair'),
```

#### C. Status Update Schema
```javascript
status: Joi.string()
  .valid('Operational', 'Under Maintenance', 'Out of Service', 'Needs Repair')
  .required(),
```

---

### 3. Backend - Equipment Controller

**File:** `backend/modules/workforce-facility/controllers/EquipmentController.js`

#### A. Updated Dashboard Statistics Query
**Before:**
```javascript
const maintenanceCount = await Equipment.countDocuments({ 
  status: { $in: ['Under Maintenance', 'Scheduled for Maintenance'] }
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const maintenanceCount = await Equipment.countDocuments({ 
  status: 'Under Maintenance'
});
```

#### B. Updated Maintenance Request Handler
**Before:**
```javascript
let newStatus = 'Scheduled for Maintenance';
if (priority === 'High') {
  newStatus = 'Needs Repair';
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
let newStatus = 'Under Maintenance';
if (priority === 'High') {
  newStatus = 'Needs Repair';
}
```

### 4. Frontend - Equipment List Table

**File:** `frontend/src/features/equipment-maintenance/components/EquipmentListTable.jsx`

#### A. Removed Status Filter Option
Removed the "Scheduled" option from the status filter dropdown.

#### B. Removed Status Badge Rendering
Removed the case for "Scheduled for Maintenance" status badge display.

---

### 5. Frontend - Add Equipment Modal

**File:** `frontend/src/features/equipment-maintenance/components/AddEquipmentModal.jsx`

Removed "Scheduled for Maintenance" option from the status dropdown:
```jsx
<option value="Operational">Operational</option>
<option value="Under Maintenance">Under Maintenance</option>
<option value="Out of Service">Out of Service</option>
<option value="Needs Repair">Needs Repair</option>
```

---

### 6. Frontend - Edit Equipment Modal

**File:** `frontend/src/features/equipment-maintenance/components/EditEquipmentModal.jsx`

Removed "Scheduled for Maintenance" option from the status dropdown (same as Add Equipment Modal).

---

## Current Equipment Status Options

After this update, the available equipment statuses are:

1. ‚úÖ **Operational** - Equipment is working normally
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Under Maintenance** - Equipment is undergoing maintenance (scheduled or reactive)
3. ‚ùå **Out of Service** - Equipment is not functional
4. üîß **Needs Repair** - Equipment requires immediate attention/repair

---

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
1. ‚úÖ **Simplified Status Management** - Fewer status options to choose from
2. ‚úÖ **Reduced Confusion** - Clear distinction between working and non-working equipment
3. ‚úÖ **Cleaner UI** - Fewer filter options in admin dashboard
4. ‚úÖ **Consistent Behavior** - All maintenance work uses same status regardless of planning

### Migration Considerations

#### Existing Data
- Equipment currently marked as "Scheduled for Maintenance" should be updated to "Under Maintenance" or "Operational"
- Run a data migration script to update existing records (see below)

#### Database Migration Script
```javascript
// Run this in MongoDB or via migration script
db.equipments.updateMany(
  { status: 'Scheduled for Maintenance' },
  { $set: { status: 'Under Maintenance' } }
);
```

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Verify equipment can be created with valid statuses only
- [ ] Verify equipment cannot be created with "Scheduled for Maintenance" status (validation error)
- [ ] Verify equipment updates reject "Scheduled for Maintenance" status
- [ ] Verify dashboard statistics count maintenance equipment correctly
- [ ] Verify maintenance request creation sets status to "Under Maintenance" for normal priority
- [ ] Verify maintenance request creation sets status to "Needs Repair" for high priority

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Verify status filter dropdown does not show "Scheduled" option
- [ ] Verify Add Equipment modal does not show "Scheduled for Maintenance" option
- [ ] Verify Edit Equipment modal does not show "Scheduled for Maintenance" option
- [ ] Verify equipment list displays correctly with remaining statuses
- [ ] Verify no errors when filtering equipment by status

### Data Migration Testing
- [ ] Run migration script on test database
- [ ] Verify all "Scheduled for Maintenance" records updated to "Under Maintenance"
- [ ] Verify no equipment has invalid status after migration
- [ ] Test dashboard with migrated data

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert these changes:

1. **Restore Backend Model**
   - Add "Scheduled for Maintenance" back to Equipments.js enum
   - Restore original scheduleNextMaintenance method logic

2. **Restore Validation**
   - Add "Scheduled for Maintenance" back to all three validation schemas

3. **Restore Controller Logic**
   - Update dashboard statistics to include "Scheduled for Maintenance"
   - Change handleMaintenanceRequestCreated to use "Scheduled for Maintenance" for normal priority

4. **Restore Frontend Components**

5. **Revert Data Migration**
   ```javascript
   // Only if you need to restore scheduled maintenance records

   db.equipments.updateMany(
     { 
       status: 'Under Maintenance',
       nextMaintenance: { $exists: true, $ne: null },
       lastMaintenance: { $exists: false }
     },
     { $set: { status: 'Scheduled for Maintenance' } }
   );
   ```
